# ICM Summer of Code 2017
Materials and projects for ICM Summer of Code 2017 

ICM Summer of Code is a summer program for students which aims to expand their knowledge of programming and helps them build their first real-life projects.

It includes a series of workshops which teach various skills useful in building applications. The materials from the workshops are available at this repository and include presentations(currently available only in Croatian) and code examples.

Moreover, it offers an opportunity to team up with other students and work on some of the project ideas we have prepared. The projects revolve around the problems we face in everyday life and are meant to be helpful to the student community and non-profit organisations.
